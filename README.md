# Ascii-Art 🖼️

Ascii-Art is a Go program that converts strings into graphic representations using ASCII characters. This project takes input strings (letters, numbers, special characters, and newlines) and outputs them as ASCII art using a predefined character map.

## Features 🚀

- **ASCII Art Generation**: Converts text into graphical representations using ASCII characters.
- **Handles Multiple Inputs**: Supports letters, numbers, spaces, special characters, and newlines.
- **Standard Go Packages**: Built using Go's standard library (no external dependencies).

## How It Works ⚙️

The program receives a string as input and outputs it in an ASCII-art format. For example:

**Input**:  
`Hello, World!`

**Output**:
```bash
 _    _          _   _                    __          __                 _       _   _  
| |  | |        | | | |                   \ \        / /                | |     | | | | 
| |__| |   ___  | | | |   ___              \ \  /\  / /    ___    _ __  | |   __| | | | 
|  __  |  / _ \ | | | |  / _ \              \ \/  \/ /    / _ \  | '__| | |  / _` | | | 
| |  | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) |  _           \  /\  /    | (_) | | |    | | | (_| | |_| 
|_|  |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/  ( )           \/  \/      \___/  |_|    |_|  \__,_| (_) 
                                |/                                                      
```
